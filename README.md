## Blessing Health

All frontend code is a standalone Quasar JS app located under /spa

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies

```
composer install
cd spa
yarn
```



## Setting up .env

Create a copy of .env.example and rename to .env. This is where you will store your local config.
Go to spa folder and create a copy of .env.example and rename to .env.


Setting up the database
Once we go live you can just grab a backup of the production db and use that locally. Otherwise build a new database from scratch:

php artisan migrate --seed
php artisan import:database



Start the app in development mode (hot-code reloading, error reporting, etc.)

yarn dev



By default, Quasar uses port 9001 which is specified in spa\quasar.config.js and it's allowed in config\sanctum.php
If by any chance, Quasar uses a different port, you need to add it to config\sanctum.php.


Build the app for production

yarn build



Media
Ensure media is publicly accessible for things such as report generation by symlinking the media folder as follows (from BH root folder).
This allows tools to directly link to media via their direct web url (without going through the framework).
On windows:

mklink /J "public\media" "storage\media"


On linux:

ln -s /home/wwwsites/path/to/app/public/media storage/media



PDF Reports (Browsershot / Puppeteer)
For all PDF reports to generate properly make sure you have puppeteer globally installed npm install -g puppeteer and
make sure NODE_BIN_PATH and NODE_PATH are set correctly in your .env file. Use which node to find what node you are running.
You also need to set the NODE_PATH environment variable in your apache config apache.conf file:

<Directory />
    AllowOverride none
    Require all denied
	
    SetEnv NODE_PATH "C:/path/to/your/node/node_modules"
</Directory>



Deploying to production (first time setup)

Deploy the application to the target server with appsync (configure required deployment checks etc)
For UAT environments make sure you use yarn build:uat to make a uat build with UAT-specific variables and paths as per .env.uat

Create public symlink /home/www/bh -> /home/wwwsites/bh/public

Create public symlink for the spa subfolder /home/www/bh/spa -> /home/wwwsites/bh/spa/dist

Ensure media symlinks exist (as detailed above)
Login to the server make sure the .env is properly setup and config cached
Run any migrations and seeders


## Developer Notes

For checking available components and other documentation: https://quasar.dev (you'll want to keep this tab pinned in your browser)
You can also use material icons in addition to font awesome. Available material icons can be found here: https://fonts.google.com/icons?selected=Material+Icons

Supporting both Dark and Light quasar theme. Automatically set based on users windows theme setting. You need to test any custom CSS against both modes - see here for more info: https://quasar.dev/style/dark-mode

Not using typescript for now unless compelling reason to do so later on


Laragon (Dev Only)
Laragon registers host and apache vhost entry for us to map the foldername as a domain name pointing to localhost. (domain name)
.e.g bh -> bh.localhost -> 127.0.0.1
Laragon also sets up a apache vhost so that bh.localhost -> /path/to/webroot/www/bh/public
If not using laragon, you can just use "http://localhost/bh/public" as the app url for both .env files. They both must match for Sanctum cookie auth to work correctly!
